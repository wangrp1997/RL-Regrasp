![GitHub license](https://img.shields.io/badge/license-MIT-blue.svg)

This repository contains the code implementation for the research paper titled "Center-of-Mass-Based Object Regrasping: A Reinforcement Learning Approach and the Effects of Perception Modality." The research focuses on exploring a reinforcement learning approach for object regrasping based on Center of Mass (CoM) and investigates the impact of different perception modalities.

## Overview

The code in this repository implements the algorithms and methods discussed in the paper. It includes modules for reinforcement learning, perception modalities, object regrasping, and more.

## Directory Structure

- `Sourcce/PPO/`: This directory contains implementations and related code for the CoM-based grasp algorithm based on PPO in three different modalities: tactile, force/torque, and tactile-force/torque fusion.
- `Sourcce/TD3/`: Implementation using the TD3 algorithm, please refer to the previous description.
- `Source/Baseline/`: Implementation of the four baseline methods used for comparison in the paper.
